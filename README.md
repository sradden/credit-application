# credit-application
spark/scala project that processes applications for credit cards

## overview
This is a conceptual project to determine whether a customer is successful in their application for a credit card. Applications are stored in .json files and pushed to the application processor which runs a series of business rules against the application and saves the result to a .parquet file.
